# 332project

## Progress Week 1 (10/17~10/20) 

### Progress in the week 
Set up git repository \
Scheduled weekly meeting \
Research on problems of distributed sorting 

### Goal of the next week 
Brainstorming ideas for using AI tech. 
Schedule overall milestones 

### Individual Goal 
- no separate goal yet
- every member individually research on how to design the project and use AI tech. until the next team meeting  


## Progress Week 2 (10/21~10/27)

### Progress in the week 
Define milestones for progress.

#### Milestone
1. Create input and output data.
2. Develop the worker algorithm.
3. Implement worker-master communication.
4. Implement overall sorting.
### Goal of the next week 
Setting up the project environment.
### Individual Goal 
JunHyeok: research worker-master communication methods

JaeWan: research worker algorithm and sorting/partitioning.

JiHyun: research input/output structure


## Progress Week 3 (10/28~11/3)

### Progress in the week

+ [distribued sorting](https://github.com/ellie326/332project/blob/e27bbf1035a94368238c90d0aa1eab1374cde9ce/report/week3_algorithm%20for%20sorting.pdf)
+ [sorting design (AI)](https://github.com/ellie326/332project/blob/57a21db711c9bf9cfb359c10a30065d1f86fb7ab/report/sortingDesign.md)
+ [Communication](https://github.com/ellie326/332project/blob/57a21db711c9bf9cfb359c10a30065d1f86fb7ab/report/Communication.md)

### Goal of the next week

Share above progress,
Create detailed individual plan and start coding 


### Individual goal

Jihyun: research input/output structure (Due to a delay in accessing through the firewall, I couldn't research input and output, so this week I used AI to draft pseudocode (refer to the sorting design (AI) above). Therefore, this week, I plan to look into the input and output that I couldn't cover last week) 

JunHyeok: write pseudo code for communication based on Sorting algorithm and data flow.
