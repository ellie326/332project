# 332project

## Progress Week 1 (10/17~10/20) 

### Progress in the week 
Set up git repository \
Scheduled weekly meeting \
Research on problems of distributed sorting 

### Goal of the next week 
Brainstorming ideas for using AI tech. 
Schedule overall milestones 

### Individual Goal 
- no separate goal yet
- every member individually research on how to design the project and use AI tech. until the next team meeting  


## Progress Week 2 (10/21~10/27)

### Progress in the week 
Define milestones for progress.

#### Milestone
1. Create input and output data.
2. Develop the worker algorithm.
3. Implement worker-master communication.
4. Implement overall sorting.
### Goal of the next week 
Setting up the project environment.
### Individual Goal 
JunHyeok: research worker-master communication methods

JaeWan: research worker algorithm and sorting/partitioning.

JiHyun: research input/output structure


## Progress Week 3 (10/28~11/3)
